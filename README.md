# helper-classes
Easy to use directory of useful CSS/SCSS helper classes. There's nothing earth shattering here, just wanted to centralize them so they could be easily added to new projects.

Helper classes are great for rapid web development because they allow you add basic styling as you go without ever leaving your template file.

> Note: These are written in SCSS and will require adding a few variables.
